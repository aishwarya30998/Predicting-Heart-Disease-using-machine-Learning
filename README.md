# Predicting Heart Disease using machine Learning
 Using this dataset i am intending to apply most of the classification algorithms on it

#Objectives:
Explore the Dataset: Uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data.
Conduct Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dive deep into bivariate relationships against the target.
Preprocessing Steps:
Remove irrelevant features
Address missing values
Treat outliers
Encode categorical variables
Transform skewed features to achieve normal-like distributions
Model Building:
Establish pipelines for models that require scaling
Implement and tune classification models including KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest
Emphasize achieving high recall for class 1, ensuring comprehensive identification of heart patients
Evaluate and Compare Model Performance: Utilize precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge models' effectiveness.
